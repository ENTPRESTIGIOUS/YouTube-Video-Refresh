# YouTube-Video-Refresh
This is a script for Tampermonkey where it automatically refreshes the page whenever you access the video. YouTube is sometimes janky and can produce unoptimized video players. Created using ChatGPT.

## How to Install
1. Install Tampermonkey Chrome/Firefox Extension if you haven't already.
2. Open Tampermonkey and go to Dashboard
3. Click the "+" button to create a new script
4. Paste the script that I've provided
5. Save (ctrl + s or cmd + s depending on your keybind)
6. Be sure to refresh your YouTube tab if you haven't already. Profit!
